In this project, I converted a design I created in Figma into HTML and CSS code to complete my layout.

Afterwards, I wrote a JavaScript function that generates two different random passwords.

Through this JavaScript code, I implemented random number generation, accessing random elements from an array using a random index, defining functions,
and updating the text of an HTML input element using the value property instead of textContent.

Thank you!
